I am Jun Yang (杨骏), a PhD student in the [Quantitative Biosciences Program at Georgia Tech](https://www.qbios.gatech.edu/). I am interested in theoretical and computational neuroscience (/≧▽≦)/.

I'm advised by [Dr. Hannah Choi](https://hannahchoi.math.gatech.edu/people/about-hannah-choi/). Currently, I am working on two projects: one focusing on dynamic mean-field theory for recurrent neural networks, and the other on building a circuit model for active vibrissal sensing.

Before starting my PhD, I studied at Tsinghua University, where I earned dual Bachelor's degrees in **Mathematics and Physics + Electrical Engineering** [^1]. During my undergrad years, I had the opportunity to explore neuroscience through research with [Dr. Sukbin Lim at NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/sukbin-lim) (continuous attractor models) and [Dr. Mayank Mehta at UCLA](https://mayank.pa.ucla.edu/) (analyzing electrophysiological data from the Allen Institute Visual Coding – Neuropixels dataset). Prior to these experiences, I worked on a project investigating synchronization and information decomposition with [Dr. Yang Tian](https://doloming.github.io/yangtian.github.io/index.html#about) for a few months and learned a lot from him and his works.
