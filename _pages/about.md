I am Jun Yang (杨骏), a PhD student in the [Quantitative Biosciences Program at Georgia Tech](https://www.qbios.gatech.edu/). I am interested in theoretical and computational neuroscience, especially theories on neural dynamics (/≧▽≦)/

After completing a short rotation in [Dr. Audrey Sederberg's lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/sederberg/), I'm now working on a new project exploring functional motifs and information processing in [Dr. Hannah Choi's lab](https://hannahchoi.math.gatech.edu/people/about-hannah-choi/).

Before starting my PhD, I studied at Tsinghua University, where I earned dual Bachelor's degrees in **Mathematics and Physics + Electrical Engineering** [^1]. During my undergrad years, I had the opportunity to explore neuroscience through research with [Dr. Sukbin Lim at NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/sukbin-lim) (continuous attractor models) and [Dr. Mayank Mehta at UCLA](https://mayank.pa.ucla.edu/) (analyzing electrophysiological data). Prior to these experiences, I worked on a project investigating synchronization and information decomposition with [Dr. Yang Tian](https://doloming.github.io/yangtian.github.io/index.html#about) for a few months and learned a lot from him and his works (unfortunately no publication came from that project ╮（╯＿╰）╭).

[^1]: **Mathematics and Physics** is an imprecise translation of 数理基础科学, of which a better translation is **Foundations of Mathematics and Physics**.
