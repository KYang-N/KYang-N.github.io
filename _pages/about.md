I am Jun Yang (杨骏), a PhD student in the [Quantitative Biosciences Program at Georgia Tech](https://www.qbios.gatech.edu/). I am interested in theoretical and computational neuroscience, especially theories on neural dynamics (/≧▽≦)/

Having completed a short rotation in [Dr. Audrey Sederberg's lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/sederberg/), I am working on a new projects regarding functional motifs and information processing in [Dr. Hannah Choi's lab](https://hannahchoi.math.gatech.edu/people/about-hannah-choi/).

Before starting my PhD, I studied at Tsinghua University, where I earned dual Bachelor's degrees in **Mathematics and Physics + Electrical Engineering** [^1]. During my undergraduate years, I had the chance to explore neuroscience through research with [Dr. Sukbin Lim at NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/sukbin-lim) (on continuous attractor models) and [Dr. Mayank Mehta at UCLA](https://mayank.pa.ucla.edu/) (on electrophysiological data analysis).

[^1]: **Mathematics and Physics** is a imprecise translation of 数理基础科学, of which a more better translation is **Foundations of Mathematics and Physics**.
