I am Jun Yang (杨骏), a PhD student in the [Quantitative Biosciences Program at Georgia Tech](https://www.qbios.gatech.edu/). I am interested in theoretical and computational neuroscience, especially theories on neural dynamics.

Before starting my PhD, I studied at Tsinghua University, where I earned dual Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Physics + Electrical Engineering. During my undergraduate years, I had the chance to explore neuroscience through research with [Dr. Sukbin Lim at NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/sukbin-lim) (on continuous attractor models) and [Dr. Mayank Mehta at UCLA](https://mayank.pa.ucla.edu/) (on electrophysiological data analysis).
